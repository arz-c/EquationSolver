"""Tree-Based Equation Solver by Areez Chishtie: Main Module
(CSC111 Winter 2024 Project 2)

Description
===============================

Runs the main loop of the equation solver. The user inputs an equation according
to the format provided in parse.py / get_unit. If the equation is constant,
linear, or quadratic, then the solution set is printed. The user is then asked
to view a visualization of the solution process. To view the next step in the
visualization, the user must close the current window.
